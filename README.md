# MonolithStarter

This project is intended to help developers quickly stand up a monolithic React/Spring Boot application. For the most part you can simply replace all instances of `monolithstarter` with appropriately-cased `yourprojectname` but make sure to do a Ctrl + F for `FIXME` to find places where more action is required.

This readme assumes that you have completed the [newhire checklist](https://github.com/validityhq/we_the_engineers/tree/master/newhire).

## Development Setup

During development, you may simply work on front-end and backend with independent tools.

For PC users: For all the `./mvnw` commands mentioned below use `mvnw` instead.

### To run the back-end:

```bash
# Move to the backend directory
cd monolithstarter-svc

# Start the application in dev mode
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

You will now have a host running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

### To run the front-end:

```bash
# Move to the right directory
cd monolithstarter-static

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the application in dev mode
yarn run start
```
You will now have your frontend running at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/)

To build frontend for production with minification:

```bash
yarn run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory


## Build / Deployment

### Using the right version of node.js

The repo is setup to run a specific version of node.js.  This version is managed in the `.nvmrc` file in the root directory.

In order to avoid errors related to node engine mismatches, make sure to run `nvm use` upon entering the root directory in each new terminal session. It will automatically download and set the active version to the correct one.

Pro-tip: If you're using Zsh as your bash client, there is a plugin for automatically switching node versions when entering a new directory (automatically triggers `nvm use` and  loads the version based on the directoryâ€™s `.nvmrc` config) [nvm-auto](https://github.com/dijitalmunky/nvm-auto)

Note: WINDOWS only - `.nvmrc` does not work on Windows, so `nvm use` in the root directory will not work as above. You must manually install the node.js version that needs to be used using `nvm install [version]` and then using `nvm use [version]` For more information, see this issue, which indicates there are no plans to implement this feature unfortunately (https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/128)

### Local

For local development you want both the backend and frontend running for maximum efficiency :)

### To build and run the backend:

```bash
# Move to the backend directory
cd monolithstarter-svc

# Start the application in dev mode
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

You will now have a host running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

### To build and run the front-end:

```bash
# Move to the right directory
    cd monolithstarter-static

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the application in dev mode
yarn run start
```
You will now have your frontend running at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/). Note that this won't work without the backend running!

To build frontend for production with minification:

```bash
yarn run build
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# run build script
yarn run build
```


### Docker
```bash
# Move to the monolithstarter-svc directory
cd monolithstarter-svc

# Generate a clean package
./mvnw clean package

# Construct the docker image
docker build -t monolithstarter-svc .

# Run the image container (substitute 5000 for desired port)
docker run -p 5000:8080 monolithstarter-svc
```
The full application is now accessible at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) (or whatever port you chose to use)
